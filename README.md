# 👾 sam0il's codeverse:

Hi, I'm Samoil Gjorgiev a second year student at the **Faculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Information Technologies (UP FAMNIT)**. My passion for programming began back in **Technical High School**, where I specialized in **Computer Technology and Automation**, and has only grown stronger since then.

This GitHub (and my GitLab) contain a mix of **university coursework**, **personal experiments**, and **side projects** where I explore everything from web design to game development and system-level C programming.
